# Hotel-Management
Project developed in Objective-C class

MyHotel management
MyHotel need an application developed with Objective-C to manage their different types of rooms and services. Your application should provide the following services:
1- Each customer reserving a room should have a profile in the system containing name, id, address, the time period of reservation, type of the room.
2- When a customer makes a reservation of a particular room, he can add some extra services (sauna, fitness center, etc). The application should manage a waiting list to add customers to if the hotel is full.
3- The application should give employees the information about the roomâ€™s status, such as: searching for a room by its number in order to check the room status (reserved or unreserved), displaying all unreserved rooms and their types, etc.
4- The application should allow the employees to reserve a room for a customer and then release it when the customer leaves the hotel or he`s canceling the reservation.
5- When a customer leaves the hotel, the application should display a bill for him and how much the customer paid and how much should he pay before leaving the hotel when he/she is about to leave.
6- The hotel needs an employer management system as well, and needs you to create the possible scenario (class diagram and algorithm), the human and material resources needed, the steps and the time consuming for development and installation of the application on theirs network of 5 Mac and 5 PCs (the constraints and possible solutions).
